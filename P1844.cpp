1844. Replace All Digits with Characters
You are given a 0-indexed string s that has lowercase English letters in its even indices and digits in its odd indices.
There is a function shift(c, x), where c is a character and x is a digit, that returns the xth character after c.
For example, shift('a', 5) = 'f' and shift('x', 0) = 'x'.
For every odd index i, you want to replace the digit s[i] with shift(s[i-1], s[i]).
Return s after replacing all digits. It is guaranteed that shift(s[i-1], s[i]) will never exceed 'z'.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
shift(s[i-1], s[i]) <= 'z' for all odd indices i.

        }

        return s;
