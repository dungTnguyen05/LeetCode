986. Interval List Intersections
You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.
Return the intersection of these two interval lists.
A closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.
The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].

Example 1:
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]

Example 2:
Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
Output: []

Constraints:
0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000
firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1
0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^9
end_i < start_(i+1)
0 <= start_j < end_j <= 10^9 
end_j < start_(j+1)
